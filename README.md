# MeLi Model to estimatite a sell

As part of the solution for the Take Home, we a Bayesian Ridge Regressor to classify if a publication with a set parameters will, probably, have a sell. We assume, the user wants to estimate considering the publication will be active. 

Besides of that, we showed the weights of the coeficients of the model, and a standarization so we can interpretate them with the given parameters. 

A future work would be to add a t-sne cluster classification for words and show the some data distribution.
